<p>One of the best ways for a student interested in a college degree or career in computer science to explore the field is to attend a pre-college course, internship, summer camp, or other related program. 
These programs are typically presented by college or university computer science departments, whose goal is to excite and encourage students of all ages and educational levels to consider a career in computers. 
The following is a list of some of the most popular pre-college programs, but it is far from exhaustive. Students should contact their local postsecondary institutions for programs offered in their area.</p>
